This is a Covid Tracker App where it will track the number of covid positive cases, casualties for a particular region.

In the app I have used Firebase email authentication for registration.
Retrofit Library for api call to fetch datas.
Jetpack Compose for the UI design.
This app is solely built using Kotlin in Android Studio and followed MVVM architecture throughout the app.
The datas I fetched from the api is very limited because I chose the free api and most of them are not free.
